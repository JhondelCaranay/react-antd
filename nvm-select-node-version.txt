For Windows:
Install nvm-windows:
Download and install nvm-windows from the nvm-windows GitHub repository.

List available Node.js versions:
After installing nvm-windows, you can list the available Node.js versions by running:

    
    > nvm list available
    
Install a specific Node.js version:
Choose the Node.js version you want to install from the list and install it using:

    
    > nvm install <version>

Switch Node.js versions:
Once you have multiple Node.js versions installed, you can switch between them using:

    
    > nvm use <version>

Set default Node.js version (optional):
You can set a default Node.js version to be used in new shell sessions by running:

    
    > nvm alias default <version>

Make sure to replace <version> with the desired Node.js version number (e.g., 14.17.0).

After following these steps, you should be able to switch between Node.js versions as needed for your projects.
